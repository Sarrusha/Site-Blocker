My personal webpage blocker to get rid of distractions. Privacy Friendly.

Features:
Block current page or entire site
Choose duration (1 week or 1 month)
Automatic expiration of blocks
View active blocks in options page

The extension uses Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API for blocking and follows Manifest V3 requirements. Blocked sites are automatically unblocked after the selected duration, and you can view all active blocks in the options page.
